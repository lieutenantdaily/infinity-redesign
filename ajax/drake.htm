        Looking for a Drake State Technical College bookstore in Huntsville? Perhaps we can help you.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity College Bookstore can get used and new textbooks for your Drake State classes at very substantial discounts.
        <br>
        <br>They are much cheaper than what you’d have to pay elsewhere. We also offer textbook rentals on some Drake titles.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity is about six miles from the Drake campus in Huntsville. It’s only a 10 to 15-minute drive, so it’s relatively close and the savings are worth it. Here is a <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">map and directions</a>, plus our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">store hours</a>.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity College Bookstore typically doesn’t carry Drake State textbooks in stock, but we can order most new or used textbooks for you. Orders usually arrive the next business day, so there’s just a short wait.
        <br>
        <br>Please bring the ISBN numbers for the books you need so we can help you get the right titles. The course title is often OK, but ISBN numbers are best. They are often found on a course syllabus, or the college’s bookstore website.
        <br>
        <br>We also buy J.F. Drake textbooks from students year-round. Our buyback prices are often the highest in Huntsville. We even buy some old editions and books with water damage that are hard to sell! Learn more about our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#five">buyback program</a>.
        <br>
        <br>There are a few limitations to what we can do:
        <ul style="list-style-type:square; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 45px;">
            <br><li>We are unable to accept Pell Grants and financial aid. We only take cash, credit cards, debit cards, and checks.</li>
            <br><li>We are unable to get customized editions for Drake State.</li>
            <br><li>Please note that we do not usually buy back Drake State’s customized editions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>If you’d like to save a trip, you can give us a call at (256) 513-9181 to make sure we can get the books you need or buy the books you have.
        <br>
