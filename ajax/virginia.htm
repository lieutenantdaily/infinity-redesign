        <br>Infinity College Bookstore buys Virginia College textbooks from students year-round. Students often find that we’re the only local store willing to buy their textbooks.
        <br>
        <br>We even buy some old editions and books with water damage that are hard to sell! Here's more about our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#five">buyback program</a>.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity is just a few miles from the Virginia College campus in Huntsville, AL. It’s only a 5-minute drive. The best thing to do is to bring all your books at once, even the ones from prior semesters. Here is a page where you can see a <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">map and directions</a>, plus our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">store hours</a>.

        <br>If you have just a couple of books to sell and would like to save a trip, you can give us a call at (256) 513-9181 to make sure we can buy the books you have. If you have lots of books, it’s best to bring them by and let us price them in person.
        <br>
        <br>So how much money do you get? Well, it varies widely. Lots of students get between $20-40, especially if they have less than ten books. There are quite a few people who “clean out their closets,” bringing 20-30 books, many from previous semesters. These students often receive $100 or more for the books that still have value.
