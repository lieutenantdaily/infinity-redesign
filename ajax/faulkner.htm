        Looking for a Faulkner University bookstore in Huntsville?
        <br>
        <br>Infinity College Bookstore can get used and new textbooks for your Faulkner University classes at very substantial discounts.
        <br>
        <br>They are much cheaper than what you’d have to pay elsewhere. We also offer textbook rentals on some Faulkner titles.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity is about two miles from the Faulkner campus in Huntsville. It’s only a 5-minute drive, so the store is very close and the savings are well worth it. Here is a <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">map and directions</a>, plus our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">store hours</a>.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity College Bookstore typically doesn’t carry Faulkner University textbooks in stock, but we can order most new or used textbooks for you. Orders usually arrive the next business day, so there’s just a short wait.
        <br>
        <br>Please bring the ISBN numbers for the books you need so we can help you get the right titles. The course title is often OK, but ISBN numbers are best. ISBNs are often found on a course syllabus or the University’s book list.
        <br>
        <br>We also buy Faulkner University textbooks from students year-round. Our buyback prices are usually the highest in Huntsville. We even buy some old editions and books with water damage that are hard to sell! Here is more information about our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul" href="#five">buyback program</a>.
        <br>
        <br>If you’d like to save a trip, you can give us a call at (256) 513-9181 to make sure we can get the books you need or buy the books you have. If you are not located in the Huntsville area, you may call us to arrange to sell your books. You can mail us the books, and we’ll mail you a check for them.
