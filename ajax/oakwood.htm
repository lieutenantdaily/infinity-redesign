        Looking for a Oakwood bookstore in Huntsville? Perhaps we can help you.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity College Bookstore can get used and new textbooks for your Oakwood classes at very substantial discounts.
        <br>
        <br>They are much cheaper than what you’d have to pay elsewhere. We also offer textbook rentals on some Oakwood titles.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity is about four miles from the Oakwood campus in Huntsville. It’s only a 5 to 10-minute drive, so it’s relatively close and the savings are worth it. Here is a <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">map and directions</a>, plus our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#three">store hours</a>.
        <br>
        <br>Infinity College Bookstore typically doesn’t carry Oakwood textbooks in stock, but we can order most new or used textbooks for you. Orders usually arrive the next business day, so there’s just a short wait.
        <br>
        <br>Please bring the ISBN numbers for the books you need so we can help you get the right titles. The course number and section are often OK, but ISBN numbers are best. They are often found on a course syllabus, or the University Bookstore’s website.
        <br>
        <br>We also buy Oakwood textbooks from students year-round. Our buyback prices are usually the highest in Huntsville. We even buy some old editions and books with water damage that are hard to sell! Learn more about our <a class="cursorhand bold-ul"  href="#five">buyback program</a>.
        <br>
        <br>Our new Oakwood University bookstore has another great option: textbook rentals. Rentals typically cost around half the price of a new book. You simply pay the rental price, use the book for your class, and return the book to the bookstore at the end of the semester. You can write and highlight in the book in moderate amounts. Check out the full details of our textbook <a href="faq_rentals.html">rental program</a>.
        <br>
        <br>There are a few limitations to what we can do:

            <br><li>We do not sell or rent religious titles for Oakwood.</li>
            <br><li>We are unable to get customized editions for Oakwood.</li>
            <br><li>Please note that we do not usually buy back Oakwood’s’ customized editions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>If you’d like to save a trip, you can give us a call at (256) 513-9181 to make sure we can get the books you need or buy the books you have.
